John Brandon's Resume
===================

The style files and Makefile were originally forked from https://github.com/mszep/pandoc\_resume/ 

Here's a nice write-up describing the process for using a ConTeXt (or CSS) style file to typeset a resume written in Markdown:
mszep.github.io/pandoc_resume/


Further instructions from the original README:

    git clone https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume
    cd pandoc_resume
    vim resume.md   #insert your own resume info
    make

Requirements:

 * ConTeXt
 * pandoc
