Bio 
----

John is originally from Davis, CA. His mom and dad are a botanist and entomologist, respectively. He became interested in wildlife science as a kid, when he started fishing and hunting with family and learning about take quotas. He became serious about studying quantitative ecological applications in college. As a college-student hire for NMFS, he got his foot in the door working on protected species his senior year. Now married, and a father of two. In his free time: he enjoys cultivating native wildflowers, gardening vegetables, fishing, hunting, and rinsing sand and saltwater off wetsuits.
