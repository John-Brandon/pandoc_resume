John Brandon's Resume :surfer: :globe_with_meridians: :seedling: :floppy_disk:
===================

This is a forked repository with files for my personal one page resume. I've updated the *TeX* style file to a format that is to my liking for mixing subsections with different bullet styles. I found Chapter 10 of the ['*ConTeXt* the manual'](http://www.ctex.org/documents/context/cont-enp.pdf) documented what I was looking to customize. 

Here's a nice write-up describing the motivation and process for using a ConTeXt (or CSS) style file to typeset a resume written in Markdown:

    cd pandoc_resume
    vim resume.md   #insert your own resume info
    make

Requirements:
