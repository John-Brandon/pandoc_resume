John provides modeling and statistical support to his clients, including a National Science
Foundation initiative for Fishery Science, and The Makah Tribal Council (Neah Bay, WA). Previously he worked
as a staff environmental consultant, developing photo-identification, and point- and line-transect survey designs for wildlife monitoring and
mitigation studies in Alaska and Canada. His field assignments have included vessel and aerial surveys for marine
protected species in the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Ocean.

Education 
---------

2003-2009
:   **PhD, Quantitative Fisheries Science**. University of Washington (Seattle):
%:    *Quantifying Uncertainty and Incorporating Environmental Stochasticity in Stock Assessments of
%    Marine Mammals.*

1994-1998
:   **BSc, Biology, Ecology and Evolution**. University of California, San Diego: National Merit Scholar; Provost Honors; Men's Soccer; Teaching
    Assisstant.
:    *Minors: Climate Science (Scripps Institute of Oceanagraphy) and Anthropology*

Professional Positions 
---------- 
2016-–present
:   **Population Dynamics and Statistical Consultant to the The Makah Tribe, Neah Bay, WA:** 
:   Computational risk assessments of proposed gray whale hunt plans and catch limit algorithms. 
Involves collaboration with lawyers representing the tribe; the tribe's lead biologist; federal agency and international scientists. 
This work is relevant to both: (i) the International Whaling Commission which has jurisdiction over the hunt quotas, and (ii) the ongoing U.S. domestic process under NOAA for determining whether the Makah Tribe should be granted a statutory waiver 
to resume their whaling tradition as provided in the Treaty of Neah Bay (1855).

2014–present
:   **Management Strategy Evaluation Consultant:** 
:   U.S. National Science Foundation’s Industry and University Cooperative Research Center for Fishery Science. This work has involved collaboration with 
a team of scientists, representatives from Atlantic commercial finfish fisheries, and agency scientists (NMFS). The focus of research is applying analytical 
methods to reduce uncertainty in estimates of conservation risk for commercial fisheries bycatch of marine mammals. 
A recent project, funded by the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council (Honolulu, HI), was published and includes an open source code repository for reproducibility (Brandon et al. 2017).
 
2009–2015
:	  **Biostatistician / Fisheries Scientist (Staff):** 
:   Aerial Survey Lead for monitoring and mitigation efforts around Shell’s Arctic Offshore Exploratory Drilling Program: LGL and Greeneridge Sciences, Inc. 
I trained local Alaskan Native Iñuit to join a crew of field scientists and collect aerial
survey data; coordinated LGL’s aerial survey effort with our client’s oil and gas operations in the
Arctic, and; developed simulations varying spatial survey effort allocation, which led to an aerial
survey design that maximized the statistical power of detecting industrial effects on the bowhead
whale migration route. Developed R (GIS) code to automate post-survey map production, including
overlapping aerial effort and sightings data, acoustic call detections, marine industrial activities
and shipboard sightings data.  The maps were used to support analyses of potential disturbance and
meet permit reporting requirements.

Bio 
----

Originally from Davis, CA. Mom and Dad are a botanist and entomologist. Eldest son of two; brother captains marine ferries in Alaska.
Became interested in wildlife science and quota limits when I was taught to how to fish and hunt as a kid. Now married, and a father of two. 
I enjoy gardening and surfing in my free time.
