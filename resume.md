John provides modeling and statistical support as an independent consultant to his clients, including: a National Science
Foundation (NSF) research center initiative, and The Makah Tribal Council. 
This work involves evaluating the performance of alternative management strategies using computational statistics. 
He also prepares testimony on these applications as an expert witness under federal judicial oversight of aboriginal whaling. 
Previously, he worked as a staff consultant, leading the development of survey designs based on statistical power analysis. 
These studies successfully informed operational management decisions for foreign and multinational corporate clients under multi-billion dollar natural resource development projects.

Bio 
----

John is originally from Davis, CA. His mom and dad are a botanist and entomologist. John grew up working on experiments with green beans and bumble-bees. He was at his mom's hip planting seed plots during the 1980's, to help demonstrate to undergraduate students experimental approaches to estimating the effects of light levels on green bean growth. The first time he led a science experiment, he was in elementary school; in 4th grade he estimated the number of 'rolly-polly' insects in his backyard using a white-out brush and a simple Lincoln-Peterson estimator. He was stung many times by the bee hives in the yard, before he learned to leave better off alone, yet he remains a curious autodidact. He became interested in wildlife science as a kid, when he started fishing and hunting with family and learning about take quotas. He became serious about studying quantitative ecological applications in college. As a college-student hire for NMFS, he got his foot in the door working on protected species his senior year. Now married, and a father of two. In his free time: he enjoys cultivating native wildflowers, gardening vegetables, fishing, hunting, and rinsing sand and saltwater off wetsuits.
